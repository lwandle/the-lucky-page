## Reason Why For Tailwind CSS

JSX in an inteeresting paradigm, where Javascript is amalgamated with HTML.
I feel the missing part in this is CSS.
CSS-In-JS libraries have tried to address this but I dont feel they scale.
Tailwind can be used even outside your component in your vanilla html, keeping your app consistent

## Issues and Solutions

I was caught in 2 minds regarding the home page design for mobile.
I was able to keep the same design in smaller device but the text was unreadable.
Removing the curved design and the phoen images I managed to resolve this issue on mobile.

## What Could Have Been differently With More Time.

- Nest all the SVGs in 1 SVG for the Home page, to improve code quality.
- Use Typescript instead of JSDocs, I wanted to experiment with JSDoc but the hype around it I feel is unwarranted, I regret not using Typescript.
- Unit test for the request form. from the time I recieved this project it has been the worst time for load shedding.
- cleanup index.html.
